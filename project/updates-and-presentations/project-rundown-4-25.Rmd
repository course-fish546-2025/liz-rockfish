## Welcome to my FISH 546 project!

As stated in my repo README, I will be looking at rockfish genetics and creating a population structure PCA plot.\

As of April 25th, I am currently working on running my RAD-seq data through the STACKS2 pipeline.\

I'm having issues with my data in the `process_radtags` step in Hyak, so I don't currently have files in raven to show for this, but I will have more things uploaded next week as I am troubleshooting over the weekend!
